Nigeria Gas Production & Utilisation Analysis (2025)
===================================

Project Overview
-----------------------------------
This project analyzes Nigeria’s monthly gas production and utilisation performance for 2025 (January – September) using official data from the Nigerian National Petroleum Company Limited (NNPC).

The goal is to evaluate:

- Gas production trends  
- Utilisation efficiency  
- Gas flaring performance (ESG focus)  
- Domestic vs export gas allocation  
- Operational efficiency indicators  

The project demonstrates real-world energy analytics, combining data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, and insight generation using Python.

Industry Context
-----------------------------------
Natural gas plays a critical role in Nigeria’s:

- Power generation  
- Industrial growth  
- Export revenue (LNG)  
- Environmental sustainability  

Gas flaring is a major environmental and economic issue, making utilisation efficiency a key national KPI. Nigeria targets **95%+ gas utilisation** — this analysis evaluates progress toward that goal.

Dataset
-----------------------------------
**Source:** NNPC Monthly Gas Production Reports  
**Period Covered:** January – September 2025  
**Unit:** MMSCF (Million Standard Cubic Feet)  
**Data Type:** Aggregated national production data  

Key Columns
-----------------------------------
- AG Production (Associated Gas)  
- NAG Production (Non-Associated Gas)  
- Total Gas Production  
- Field Use  
- Domestic Sales  
- Export Sales  
- Total Gas Utilised  
- % Utilised  
- Total Gas Flared  
- % Flared  
- Gas Shrinkage  

⚠️ **Note:** July and September data are marked *provisional* by NNPC.

Tools & Technologies
-----------------------------------
- Python  
- Pandas – data cleaning & analysis  
- Matplotlib – visualizations  
- Jupyter Notebook – analysis workflow  
- CSV / PDF extraction – data preparation  

Analysis Performed
-----------------------------------

1️⃣ Monthly Gas Production Trend
-----------------------------------
- Total gas production trend across months  
- Comparison of AG vs NAG contribution  

**Insight:**  
Production fluctuates across the year, with mid-year peaks driven mainly by increased NAG production.

2️⃣ Gas Utilisation Efficiency Analysis
-----------------------------------
- Mean utilisation rate  
- Best and worst performing months  
- Comparison against the 95% national target  

**Key Findings:**  
- Average utilisation: ~92.5%  
- Best month: July  
- Worst month: September  
- Nigeria did not consistently meet the 95% target  

3️⃣ Gas Flaring Analysis (ESG Focus)
-----------------------------------
- Monthly flaring volume and percentage  
- Flaring intensity (flared ÷ produced)  

**Insight:**  
Although utilisation remains relatively high, gas flaring persists and increases in some months, highlighting continued environmental and economic losses.

4️⃣ Domestic vs Export Gas Sales
-----------------------------------
- Monthly domestic gas supply  
- Monthly export gas volumes  
- Domestic-to-export ratio  

**Insight:**  
Exports account for a significant share of gas utilisation, reflecting Nigeria’s LNG dependency, while domestic supply fluctuates.

5️⃣ Gas Flow Efficiency (Value Chain View)
-----------------------------------
Tracks gas movement across the value chain:

Production → Field Use → Domestic → Export → Flared  

This provides a clear energy value-chain perspective for stakeholders.

6️⃣ Shrinkage Analysis
-----------------------------------
- Computed gas shrinkage percentage as an operational efficiency metric  

**Insight:**  
Shrinkage represents processing and transmission losses, which may indicate infrastructure or operational inefficiencies.

7️⃣ Production vs Utilisation Correlation
-----------------------------------
- Scatter analysis of total production vs utilisation %  

**Insight:**  
Higher production does not always translate to better utilisation, highlighting capacity and infrastructure constraints.

8️⃣ Cumulative Performance Analysis
-----------------------------------
- Cumulative gas produced  
- Cumulative gas utilised  
- Cumulative gas flared  

**Insight:**  
Shows year-to-date progress toward annual gas management targets.

Key Insights Summary
-----------------------------------
- Nigeria’s average gas utilisation in 2025 remains below the 95% target  
- Gas flaring, while reduced compared to production, is still significant  
- Export demand plays a major role in gas allocation  
- Operational inefficiencies (shrinkage & flaring) present improvement opportunities  

Why This Project Matters
-----------------------------------
This project demonstrates:

- Energy sector domain knowledge  
- ESG-focused analytics  
- End-to-end data workflow (PDF → CSV → Analysis → Insights)  
- Industry-relevant KPIs used by regulators and operators  

It is suitable for roles in:

- Energy & Financial Analytics  
- Data Analysis / Data Science  
- ESG & Sustainability Analytics  
- Oil & Gas Strategy & Reporting  

Next Improvements
-----------------------------------
- Add 2024 vs 2025 year-on-year comparison  
- Add forecasting (ARIMA / regression)  
- Expand analysis to crude oil (upstream)
